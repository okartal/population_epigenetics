# Mathematical Modeling of Population Epigenetics

The aim of the project is to estimate the probability of gain and loss of DNA
methylation variants across generations. To this end, we use probabilistic
modeling and bisulfite-sequencing data.

## Instructions

Run from the command line with:
```sh
$ snakemake -pj --use-conda --snakefile <path/to/Snakefile>
