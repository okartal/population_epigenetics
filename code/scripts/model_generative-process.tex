\begin{enumerate}
\item The read count for 5mC (\(m_i\)) follows a binomial distribution
  with the number of trials being the total read count (\(n_i\)) and
  the probability of success being \(p_i = M_i / 2\), where \(M_i\) is
  the number of 5mC alleles in the diploid.
  \begin{displaymath}
    m_i \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, \frac{M_i}{2})
  \end{displaymath}
\item The number of 5mC alleles in the diploid (\(M_i\)) follows a
  binomial distribution with two trials and the probability of success
  being equal to the allele frequency of 5mC among the gametes,
  \(\pi\). (what about selfing since we have a different freq from one
  mother to the other, this \(\pi\) is specific to the mother of plant
  \(i\)?)
  \begin{displaymath}
     M_i \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(2, \pi)
  \end{displaymath}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{align}
  Z_{t+1}|Z_t &\sim \mathrm{Binomial}(2N, g(x_t))
  \\ \mathrm{logit}(\pi_{it}) &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\Theta X^t\beta)
